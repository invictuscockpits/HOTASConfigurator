Choosing the appropriate files:

Aluminum Parts:  

We recommend having these parts made from aluminum, typically 5052 is a good alloy for this.  You can also use 6061.
You could also use an appropriately thick Baltic birch or acrylic, but we do not recommend it as it is much more likely
break or become damaged.

No Dog Bones:

These files are to be used when you want to square the corners by hand or otherwise change the size of the dog bones.  Remember, 
CNC end mills are round, so all inner corners will be rounded when the parts come off the router.  The parts will not fit when 
the corners are round.  You will have to square them with a saw or sharp chisel.  We recommend using the versions with added
dog bones for simplicity and ease of assembly.  

A professional CNC shop may prefer the no dog bones version so that they can add their own dog bones at a different size more
appropriate to the diameter of the end mill they are using.

Standard Cockpit Version:

The files in this folder are meant to be used with the standard size of the F-16 Cockpit Plans by Alert 5 Design Studio.  All 
versions use the same 3mm and 12mm files.  The 18mm file is chosen based on the criteria outlined below.

XL Cockpit Version

The files in this folder are meant to be used with the XL size of the F-16 Cockpit Plans by Alert 5 Design Studio.  All 
versions use the same 3mm and 12mm files.  The 18mm file is chosen based on the criteria outlined below.

Choosing which of the 18mm files to cut:

If you are using version 1 of the Alert 5 Design Studio cockpit plans, be sure to choose the 18mm file labeled for Version 1 in the
correct size of your cockpit frame (Standard or XL). The only difference between Version 1 and the other files are that version 1 
does not contain tenons to fit the base into the cockpit frame.  Version 1 of the cockpit plans do not have mortises to accept 
those tenons. If you accidentally cut version 2 18mm parts, you will likely have to either cut the mortises by hand (not easy), 
or cut off the tenons (much easier). You only need ONE 18mm file.  The rest can be ignored.  


The differences of the files purely relate to the base to which the seat mounts.  The STLs, etc., do not change between sizes.
so if you cut the wrong size parts, you need only recut the parts for the base.
